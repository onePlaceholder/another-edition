### Compilation Guide
1. You'll need a custom **packwiz** version, **[packardry](https://github.com/onePlaceholder/packardry)** (build it like a regular go project with the `go build` command), add it to your path or whatever.
2. Then build the coremod using the `build_coremod.sh` script.
3. Finally build the modpack using the `build_modpack.sh` script, the output is in the `build` folder.
